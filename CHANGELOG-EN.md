## Nest updates

- During the first half of 2023, updates will be released on the Historic centres dataset following some corrective maintenance activities that are being carried out on the CSRS Web System. The releases will also lead to an enrichment of the dataset in order to encourage the reuse of data and therefore will be accompanied by the opening of some new Discussions to better analyze the interactions between the Historic centres and some topics related to seismic risk such as for example: the impact of the disasters (see red zones of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake) and the relationship between these and certain national dynamics involving the Historic centres (depopulation, strategy of Internal Areas, interventions regarding "borghi" in the PNRR).

## 2023-06-12

- Updating of data relating to the emergencies of Italian historic centers (for this layer there was also an enrichment of information) and to areas with a high concentration of historic buildings (before 1945) in areas of historical interest in the Regions of Basilicata, Calabria, Campania and Puglia.

## 2022-12-05

- Publication of dataset relating to the locations of Italian historic centres and polygons regarding areas with a high concentration of historic buildings (before 1945) in areas of historical interest in the Basilicata, Calabria, Campania and Apulia Regions.
